An interactive world map that visualizes real-time COVID-19 data by country. Hover over any country to view up-to-date statistics including confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. The map is enriched with national flags, a global summary bar, and a side panel showing the top 5 most affected countries by cases.

##  Project Motivation

This project was developed to combine front-end web development with real-world data visualization. Amid a global pandemic, I wanted to create a tool that not only informs but also highlights how connected we all are. It‚Äôs not about one country or another, this map represents a shared global experience.

This website also served as a way to practice dynamic JavaScript rendering, responsive design, and working with APIs.
